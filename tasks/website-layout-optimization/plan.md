# Website Layout Optimization Plan

## Task Summary
Emily has identified a layout issue on PrecisionConvert.io where there's a section midway down the page with "basically nothing there but tiny images". She wants to:
1. Move the "What is the best free unit converter?" section to that location
2. Have Atlas do another SEO review for additional opportunities

## Current Analysis

### Current Page Structure:
1. **Header** - Navigation
2. **"What is the best free unit converter?" Section** - Currently positioned early (line ~788)
   - Green background (#f0fdf4)
   - Contains structured answer with checkmarks
   - High-value SEO content
3. **Hero Section** - Main title and CTA
4. **Converter Section** - The actual tool
5. **Feature Highlights** - Cards with emoji icons (ðŸŽ¯, ðŸ“š, âš¡, ðŸ”’)
6. **Example Conversions** - Popular conversion examples
7. **Professional Categories** - Engineers, Chefs, Historians sections
8. **Why Choose PrecisionConvert** - Benefits section
9. **FAQ Section**
10. **Final CTA**
11. **Footer**

### Identified Issue:
The "Feature Highlights" section (step 5) likely contains the "tiny images" Emily mentioned - these are emoji icons (ðŸŽ¯, ðŸ“š, âš¡, ðŸ”’) that might appear small on certain devices or browsers.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Content Reorganization
1. **Remove** the "What is the best free unit converter?" section from its current early position
2. **Replace** the "Feature Highlights" section with the "What is the best free unit converter?" content
3. **Relocate** the feature highlights to a more appropriate position or integrate into another section

### Phase 2: SEO Enhancement
1. **Atlas Review**: Have Atlas analyze the new layout for additional SEO opportunities
2. **Content Optimization**: Implement any additional SEO recommendations
3. **Schema Updates**: Ensure structured data reflects the new layout

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation
1. **Visual Testing**: Ensure the new layout looks good on all devices
2. **SEO Testing**: Verify that the move doesn't hurt SEO performance
3. **User Experience**: Confirm the flow still makes sense
