# Website Layout Optimization Research

## Task Overview
Emily has identified an issue with the PrecisionConvert.io website layout:
- There's a section midway down the page with "basically nothing there but tiny images"
- She wants to move the "What is the best free unit converter?" section to that location
- She also wants Atlas to do another SEO review for additional opportunities

## Current Website Analysis

### Current Structure (from web fetch):
1. **Header** - Navigation with trending, seasonal, AI guide, blog links
2. **"What is the best free unit converter?" Section** - Currently positioned early, after header
   - Green background (#f0fdf4)
   - Contains structured answer with checkmarks
   - Lists key features: 15-decimal precision, 1000+ units, batch conversion, etc.
3. **Hero Section** - Main title and CTA buttons
4. **Converter Section** - The actual unit converter tool
5. **Feature Highlights** - "All Advanced Features - 100% FREE"
6. **Example Conversions** - Popular conversion examples
7. **Professional Categories** - Engineers, Chefs, Historians sections
8. **Why Choose PrecisionConvert** - Benefits section
9. **FAQ Section**
10. **Final CTA**
11. **Footer**

### Issue Identified:
- Need to locate the section with "tiny images" that Emily mentioned
- This is likely in the middle section of the page
- The "What is the best free unit converter?" section should be moved there for better positioning

### Current SEO Elements Found:
- Comprehensive schema markup (WebApplication, Calculator, FAQ, HowTo, Breadcrumb)
- Meta tags optimized for "free unit converter" keywords
- Structured content with proper headings
- Internal linking to specialized pages (scientific, cooking converters)
- Blog integration section

## Next Steps:
1. Examine the HTML more carefully to find the section with tiny images
2. Plan the content reorganization
3. Have Atlas review for additional SEO opportunities
4. Implement the changes
