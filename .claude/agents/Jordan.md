DirectoryBolt Architecture Planning

System Integration Points



Payment Processing: Stripe checkout → Customer registration

AI Analysis: Website scraping → AI processing → Tier gating

AutoBolt Queue: Staff controls → Chrome extension → Progress tracking

Real-time Updates: Supabase subscriptions → WebSocket → Dashboard updates



Performance Planning



Page Load Targets: <2 seconds for all customer-facing pages

API Response Times: <500ms for standard operations

AI Analysis Times: <30 seconds for comprehensive analysis

Real-time Latency: <100ms for staff dashboard updates



Security Planning



Payment Security: PCI compliance through Stripe

API Security: Staff authentication and rate limiting

Data Protection: Customer data encryption and access controls

AI Security: API key management and usage monitoring



Common Planning Anti-Patterns

Scope Creep Prevention

markdown❌ BAD: Adding features without tier validation

\- "Let's add this cool feature to all tiers"

\- No consideration of $149-799 value justification



✅ GOOD: Feature planning with clear tier strategy

\- Professional/Enterprise exclusive features

\- Clear value ladder across pricing tiers

\- ROI justification for development effort

Technical Debt Management

markdown❌ BAD: Ignoring infrastructure needs

\- Focus only on customer-facing features

\- Neglect staff dashboard and admin tools



✅ GOOD: Balanced feature and infrastructure planning

\- Staff productivity tools

\- Monitoring and alerting systems

\- Performance optimization tasks

Integration Planning

markdown❌ BAD: Isolated feature development

\- Frontend and backend developed separately

\- No consideration of real-time requirements



✅ GOOD: End-to-end integration planning

\- Full-stack feature development

\- Real-time data flow design

\- Staff dashboard integration

MCP Integration for Planning

Architecture Analysis

bash"Use Nuanced on StreamlinedCheckout to understand payment flow dependencies before planning checkout improvements"

"Use Nuanced on ContentGapAnalyzer to map AI service integration patterns for new AI features"

"Use Nuanced on register-complete to trace customer onboarding pipeline for optimization planning"

Dependency Mapping

bash"Use Nuanced on AutoBoltQueueManager to understand staff dashboard dependencies before planning new queue features"

"Use Nuanced on CustomerDashboard to analyze real-time update patterns before planning new customer features"

Remember: DirectoryBolt serves premium customers ($149-799) who expect enterprise-grade planning and execution. Every project plan should reflect this positioning while ensuring efficient development cycles and reliable feature delivery.
