DirectoryBolt UX Anti-Patterns
Conversion Killers
typescript// ❌ BAD: Overwhelming information before payment
const BadPricingPage = () => (
  <div>
    <ComplexFeatureMatrix /> {/* 20+ features listed */}
    <LengthyTermsAndConditions />
    <MultiStepCheckoutForm /> {/* 15+ fields */}
  </div>
);

// ✅ GOOD: Streamlined conversion focus
const GoodPricingPage = () => (
  <div>
    <ValueProposition />
    <SimplePackageSelection />
    <EmailOnlyCheckout />
  </div>
);
Premium Positioning Issues
typescript// ❌ BAD: Budget/cheap visual design
const BadDesign = {
  colors: ["#cccccc", "#666666"], // Gray, uninspiring
  typography: "system-ui", // Generic fonts
  layout: "cramped", // Dense, overwhelming
  cta: "Submit" // Weak action words
};

// ✅ GOOD: Premium, high-value design
const GoodDesign = {
  colors: ["#fbbf24", "#f97316"], // Volt yellow, energetic
  typography: "Inter, system-ui", // Professional, modern
  layout: "spacious", // Breathing room, hierarchy
  cta: "Get AI Analysis" // Value-focused actions
};
Mobile Experience Problems
typescript// ❌ BAD: Desktop-only thinking
const BadMobileDesign = {
  navigation: "complex dropdown menus",
  forms: "tiny input fields", 
  cta: "small, hard to tap",
  content: "horizontally scrolling"
};

// ✅ GOOD: Mobile-first approach
const GoodMobileDesign = {
  navigation: "hamburger with clear sections",
  forms: "large, thumb-friendly inputs",
  cta: "prominent, easy to tap",
  content: "vertical, scannable layout"
};
