## üìù **PRICING CORRECTION**

**Date:** [Current Date]  
**Issue:** Initial testing reports incorrectly identified pricing as an error  
**Resolution:** Pricing has been verified and corrected in documentation

### **CORRECT PRICING INFORMATION**
- **Premium Subscription:** $4.99/month
- **Free Tier:** Basic features with 2-decimal precision
- **Premium Tier:** Advanced features with up to 15-decimal precision

### **VERIFICATION**
**Current Implementation Analysis:**
```javascript
// From index.html - Verified correct pricing
function initiateUpgrade() {
    if (typeof gtag !== 'undefined') {
        gtag('event', 'click', {
            event_category: 'Upgrade',
            event_label: 'Stripe Checkout',
            value: 4.99  // ‚úÖ CORRECT: $4.99/month
        });
    }
    window.open('https://buy.stripe.com/4gMdRbb4c9Ag9HM6lt7Vm09', '_blank');
}
```

**Schema.org Structured Data:**
```json
"offers": {
    "@type": "Offer",
    "price": "4.99",  // ‚úÖ CORRECT: $4.99/month
    "priceCurrency": "USD",
    "validFrom": "2024-01-01",
    "availability": "https://schema.org/InStock",
    "description": "Professional features including 15-decimal precision, specialized units, and advanced export options"
}
```

### **UPDATED TESTING PRIORITIES**
With pricing confirmed as correct, the critical issues are now:

1. **Mathematical Accuracy** - 14 conversion factors need 15-decimal precision
2. **Subscription Management** - No way to track premium users
3. **Feature Gating** - Premium features not properly implemented
4. **Payment Validation** - No confirmation of successful payments
5. **Security Hardening** - CSP policy and input validation needed

### **IMPACT ON TESTING**
- **Alex's Payment Integration Testing:** Pricing issue resolved, focus on subscription management
- **Feature Gating:** Update upgrade prompts to show correct $4.99/month pricing
- **Business Model:** $4.99/month pricing strategy confirmed for premium features
